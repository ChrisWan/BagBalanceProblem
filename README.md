# BagBalanceProblem
This generic algorithm deals with a specific bag problem: The task is to balance all weights in a way that every subset achieves similar weight. The more similar the better.
The challenge is that everything can be set, nothing is fixed. The weights and the number of items as well as the subset can be set flexibly.
